In the southern quarry the aplite, mainly within hornfelsed shales and tuffs, is about 20m thick. In the upper level of the quarry it splits into several smaller dykes. Mineralisation along joints through both the aplite and the tuffs consists mainly of fluorite. Local pegmatitic segregations contain most of the interesting minerals. In the northern quarrry the aplite comprises several dykes up to 2m in width, with many offshoots into the cherts and shales. Contacts with these rocks are often mineralised and these can be clearly seen in bot quarries. The aplite is lithium-beryllium rich, and this is reflected in the mineralogy. Petalite may be found in perthite veins and occasionally as disseminations in the aplite up to 30% by volume. Lepidolite mica is common and other lithium-rich phases include spodumene, montebrasite, amblygonite, and lithium-rich pink and green tourmalines.

It is also important for its diversity of form and has the largest available relief of any west coast dune system. In the central part of the Burrows where the highest dunes occur (up to 30m OD) there are three main parallel ridges separated by slacks and fronted by a line of foredunes. To the north and south the structure of the dunes is influenced by Saunton Down and the Taw-Torridge estuary, respectively, while to the west there is an extensive area of low dunes and slacks. The legacy of major blowouts is also apparent.

Important biostratigraphical information demonstrates that the Bideford Formation is laterally equivalent to the upper part of the Crackington Formation and the basal part of the Bude Formation of adjacent areas.  The site remarkably includes one such marker band characterised by the ammonoid Gastrioceras amaliae (Langsettian Stage) within both a Crackington Formation sequence at Babbacome Mouth and within a Bideford Formation sequence west of Cornborough, thereby proving the lateral equivalence of the two formations.

In addition to marine horizons the Bideford formation yields important non-marine bivalve assemblages including faunas of the Carbonicola lenisulcata Zone.  The formation is dominated by mudstones, siltstones and some sandstones representing at least nine deposition cycles.  Sedimentary structures including cross-stratification are locally well developed and interesting trace-fossil assemblages are also present.

The basal part of the overlying Bude Formation in addition includes an impure coal seam with traces of seat earth.  Close to this level elements of a coal Measures flora have been recorded including Neuropteris and Sphenophyllum which may indicate the Lyginopteris heminghansii (floral)  Zone.

The combination of a major lateral change from Crackington to Bideford Formation facies and the associated biostratigraphical control makes the Abbotsham Coast a site of very major importance for regional and national palaeoenvironmental and palaeogeographical studies.",Carboniferous,Coastal and River Cliffs,MERMAID`S POOL TO ROWDEN GUT
3022,Bude Coast,Devon CC,Westphalian,Culm Trough,Notified,SS213174,50.93,-4.54,221300,117400,01-Jan-96,02-Jan-00,NE,"The cliffs and foreshore between Widemouth Bay and Marsland Cliff are the type of area of the Bude Formation, the youngest division of the Carboniferous succession in Devon and Cornwall.  The formation comprises around 1290m of bedded sandstone and typically thin shales.  The sandstones are rich in sedimentary structures including sand volcanos and hummocky cross-stratification, the latter probably generated by storm waves in shallow water conditions.

Biostratigraphical control on the age of the Bude Formation is provided by thick shale horizons with marine faunas in particular ammonoids, including the Hartland Quey Shale (topmost Crackington Formation with Gastrioceras amaliae; Langsettian), the Long Peak Shale (with intermediate ammonoids and some fish remains; probably Langsettian), Toms Cove Shale (with some fish remains), Sandy Mouth Shale (with Antracoceratoides cornubiensis; Langsettian) and the Warren Gutter Shale (with Donetzoceras aegiranium and Gastrioceras depressum of basal Bolsovian age).  Although no direct evidence of the Duckmantrian stage is available, deposites of this age are undoubtedly present.

The Saturday's Pit Shale is palaeontologically particularly important as it yields fragmentary fish remains including Cornuboniscus budensis, Acanthiodes nardi and Elonicthys aitkeni and the crustacean Crangopsis huxleyi.  In addition the Toms Cove Shale yields the coelocanthid Rhabododerma elegans.  Several levels in the succession show Xiphosurid trails, again indicating a shallow water environment for much of the Bude Formation.

The combination of the Bude Formation stratotype, excellent sedimentary features, good biostratigraphical control and palaentologically important faunas makes the Bude coast one of the most important areas of exposure of Carboniferous rocks in Britain.",Carboniferous,Coastal and River Cliffs,DUCKPOOL TO FURZEY COVE

The succession comprises thin to medium bedded sandstones with siltstones and shales with well developed sedimentary structures.  In particular a priminant slumped horizon with sandstone slabs in a mudstone matrix probably represents an underwater mudflow.  This horizon is extensive and can be traced for around 3km along the coast.

Other sedimentary structures are particually well exposed and include flute and lode casts, ripple marks, flame structures and occasional sandstones with cross- and wedge- bedding.  Many of these features are typical of a relatively shallow water environment and represent the last phase of infilling of the 'Culm Trough' in Britain, a large Upper Carboniferous depositional basin extending from south-west Britain to northern Germany.  Their significance for regional palaeogeographic and palaeoenvironmental studies is therefore paramount.",Carboniferous,,

There are no mainland European freshwater faunas of the same age, since the Muschelkalk marine transgression occupies that interval of time.  The assemblage comprises the richest mid-Triassic continental amphibian fauna in Britain and probably in western Europe.  New finds, including as yet undescribed fish remains, continue to be made in situ and in fallen blocks, with erosion constantly supplying new specimens.

palaeoenvironmental conditions of the late Palaeogene within the Bovey Basin and more
widely.
Stratigraphically, Southacre Clay Pits exposes lignite and clay sediments belonging to the
Middle and Upper Bovey Formation of Oligocene age. It is the type locality for the
Southacre Clay-and-Lignite Member (including the Parks Seam) of the Middle Bovey
Formation. This is overlain by the Stover Member which belongs to the Upper Bover
Formation.
The lignite beds (some reaching 3 metres in thickness) of the Southacre Clay-and-Lignite
Member have yielded an abundant and diverse fossil flora - 33 named species belonging to
31 families of trees and other vegetation have been identified. Sedimentation in the Bovey
Basin is believed to have taken place on a river flood plan and, to a lesser extent, in
freshwater lakes. These environments are reflected by a largely derived flora dominated by
the conifer Sequoia couttsiae with the fern Osmunda lignitum and the swamp-palm Calmus
daemonorops. Also found are a number of true aquatic plants, marsh plants and various
climbers, trees and shrubs.
Pollen and spore assemblages from sections at the site closely resemble those found in
sediments of similar age in the Bristol Channel, the Irish Sea and Ulster making this site
important for understanding the late Palaeogene in the Bovey Basin and for localities of
similar age throughout Britain.",Tertiary,,
