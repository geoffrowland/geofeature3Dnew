This major source of coarse sediment has long since disappeared, leaving only a relatively small input of sediment from occasional cliff falls.  The inputs of sediment to the beach ridge from this modern source are too small to sustain the earlier beach profile and the increase in the length of the ridge as it continues to roll back, in a lengthening curve, into Porlock Bay.  This means that the ridge had been growing steadily thinner ever since it was formed.
