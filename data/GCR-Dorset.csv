At the base of the succession, the  Abbotsbury Cornbrash Formation, which although incompletely exposed, contains the Bathonian-Callovian boundary, in an area where this boundary is known to be one of the most complete in Britain (basal Keppleri subzone, Herveyi Zone faunas are known from nearby Corscombe, in Fleet Member Facies).  Higher levels in the Fleet Member yield Macrocephalites spp. of the Terebratus and Kamspsus subzones.

The overlying sequence appears to show the Kellaways Formation resting directly upon the Fleet member with no evidence of the presence of the Clayton Clay Formation, which is known further north.  The Kellaways Clay Member dominates the formation and only a thin development of the Kellaways Sand Formation is present.  The Kellaways Clay Member is richly fossiliferous, and this is the only site in Britain where the unit is permanently exposed.  It contains septarian nodules with well preserved ammonites of the Gowerianus Subzone of the Koenigi Zone, including Kepplerites (Gowericeras) ex grp. gowerianus, Cadoceras, Proplanulites and Chamoussetia.  Of particular note are effective topotypes of the zonal index Proplanulites koenigi (J. Sowerby), a species first described from nearby Rampisham.  Many bivalves including Myophorella, Catinula and Thracia are also present.

The Kellaways Sand Member yields few recognisable fossils excepting Gryphea, but the presence of Sigaloceras and Proplanulites ex grp. petrosus S. Buckman suggests a Calloviense  Zone, Calloviense Sub zone age.  Above the Kellaways Sand Member is a sequence of sandy and silty mudrocks with some calcareous lenticles in its upper part.   Ammonite faunas include Sigaloceras (Catasigiloceras) ex grp. enodatum (Nikitin), Kosmoceras (Giuielmiceras) medea Callomon, with some perisphintids and Cadoceras (the latter two groups mainly in the lower part).  Bivalves are abundant, with bands of Gryphea a higher levels.  The ammonite fauna indicates the Enodatum Subzone (Calloviense Zone) of the terminal Lower Callovian, and the Media Subzone (Jason Zone) of the basal Middle Callovian.  These levels would be assignable to the Oxford Clay Formation, but the silty character suggests that the locally developed Mohuns Park Member is present.  Ryewater may, therefore, include the only significant surface exposures of this unit, known primarily from boreholes.

Although little known, the Ryewater-Lovelands exposures are in a classical area where most of the older sites have been lost.  They reveal a remarkably complete Lower Callovian sequence yielding Callovian ammonite faunas of international importance.

The 400m of the Wessex Formation here (lower 300m concealed) is in similar facies (freshwater/periodically subaerial alluvial plain) to that seen on the Isle of Wight. Sedimentary structures and more frequent coarse sandstones suggest more vigorous and sometimes (intermittent) braided rivers. About the middle of the formation (near the south end of the proposed site) the Coarse Quartz Grit Member (3m) is a notable features, comprising pebbles and sand of predominantly Cornubian origin (high Hercynian K-feldspar and tourmaline, etc; traces of Armorican staurolite >> kyanite, Portlandian glauconite, etc). Though clearly derived and transported from the west or south-west, the Grit has been claimed, on palynological grounds, as older than further west (Worbarrow Bay). It is important to get this dating right in order to test for diachroneity and to discover how the member relates to spreads of almost identical sand in the Weald Clay, 120km further north-east. If proved to be a virtual time plane (rapid spread of detritus being possible in the favoured sedimentological models) the Grit's value as a marker bed would be high. The Vectis Formation here is likewise similar to that seen in the Isle of Wight: originally dark lake/lagoon/bay clays contain faunas and floras indicating a wider range of salinities than in the Wessex Formation. At the most 35m thick, it continues the westerly thinning seen in the Isle of Wight.

The section is vital for the palaeoenvironmental interpretation of the Lower Greensand of the south-west. A key Lower Cretaceous locality.",Cretaceous,Coastal and River Cliffs,SOUTH DORSET COAST,,

These include the normal ooid sand lithologies but here associated with algal/oyster patch reef developments, which grew on the migrating oolite dunes. Micrites form the top of the Freestone section, these are channelled in part into the ooid sands below. Purbeck algal stromatolites, with fenestral fabrics referable to gas formation within the algal mats, are well-displayed by sections above the micrites and patch reefs. A site showing unique facies and environmental indicators in the Portland Beds and Purbeck Beds.",Jurassic,,ISLE OF PORTLAND,,

These rock types and their fossil contents indicate deposition in a variety of environments includinghypersaline lagoons, soil horizons and fresh water ponds.  Representatives of the Purbeck Caps, Great Dirt Bed and Broken Beds of the Dorset coast succession occur here.  The Great Dirt Bed in particular has yeilded an important assemblage of invertebrate and plant fossils which have been the subject of detailed research.  This is a key locality for studies of facies and environments in the Purbeck Beds.  This site was originally 1527",,,,,
